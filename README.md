## About the Project

The Engineer Job Selection Prediction System is an AI-powered web application designed to help engineering candidates assess their likelihood of selection for technical roles. By analyzing various professional, academic, and personal factors, the system provides personalized insights and actionable recommendations to improve hiring prospects.

## How It Works

The system uses a machine learning model to analyze key predictors of job selection including:

- Years of Experience
- Technical Skills
- Professional Certificates
- Personal Projects
- Academic Achievements
- Extra-Academic Achievements
- Professional References

Based on these factors, the application predicts the probability of selection for an engineering position and offers tailored recommendations to improve your candidate profile.

## The Model

Our prediction engine uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on anonymized hiring data from tech companies. This model was chosen for its:

- High accuracy (~92% on test data)
- Ability to handle different types of input features
- Resistance to overfitting
- Interpretability of feature importance

The model provides not just predictions, but also insights into which factors most significantly impact selection decisions, allowing for targeted improvement strategies.
